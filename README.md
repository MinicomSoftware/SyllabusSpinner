# Syllabus Spinner
Instructions for the Syllabus Spinner game: Use the Syllabus Spinner as an interactive game between students and their course content/material. The general game involves the winner receiving candy for landing on the GOLDEN light and remaining safe by not answering a question. Players who do not land on the GOLDEN LIGHT must pull a random question from a hat that goes over either the course syllabus, questions about the course, SI, MSJC, and so on.
